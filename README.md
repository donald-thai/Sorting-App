# Sorting-App
A file sorting app created for my last project in CS3. 
Desription
-----------------
This app will sort a user chosen folder by the file types within it. It will also sort files of the same type alpbatically and is able to sort folders within the chosen folder. The goal of this application to help people be more organized, and as a result, boost their productivity.  

Files
-----------------
The code can be found in sort.py. The app itself can be found in the zip file.

Future Goals
-----------------
I plan on updating the code for this project in the future. Some of my plans include cleaning it up (increasing its readability since the comments were for my teacher) and adding new features like being able to select multiple folders at once.

Thanks for checking out my project!
